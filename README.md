# Random Background Color Changer[MINI Project]

A simple JavaScript DOM mini-project built to practice asynchronous concepts like setInterval, clearInterval, and event-driven programming.
This project focuses on logic correctness and state management rather than UI complexity.

# Project Overview
The Random Background Color Changer dynamically updates the webpage background color every second using randomly generated HEX colors.

# Users can:
Start the color change
Stop the color change
The project demonstrates how to safely manage asynchronous timers without creating duplicate intervals.

# Key Concepts Practiced
Asynchronous JavaScript
setInterval() and clearInterval()
State management
Preventing multiple intervals using a guard variable
Event-driven programming
addEventListener
DOM manipulation
Dynamic style updates
Logic-based prevention instead of disabling buttons

# Tech Stack
HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
